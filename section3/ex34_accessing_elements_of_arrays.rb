# Study Drills:
# 1. I think the year 2010 in "January 1, 2010" really is 2010 and not 2009 because it's based on a time scale that begins in "Year 0". Given we refer to centuries in this way (the 1st century was century 0, months 1-12), they follow the same principals as cardinal vs ordinal numbers. ordinal == ordered, 1st; cardinal == cards at random, 0. Years (calendars) are cardinal.
